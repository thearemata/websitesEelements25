    <h2>Relevant Implications:</h2>
        <img src="Images/SurferSilhouette_Extension.png" alt="Website Logo" class="logo">
<p>When building a website, it's important to consider the relevant implications that can impact the site's success. These implications include the target audience, purpose of the website, and website performance. Understanding the target audience helps in designing a website that resonates with them and meets their needs. The purpose of the website dictates the design, functionality, and content needed to achieve its goals. Optimising website performance is also crucial for ensuring that visitors have a positive experience and are more likely to engage with the site.</p>
<p>Being aware of these relevant implications can help designers create a website that is user-friendly, meets the needs of the target audience, and achieves its purpose. Designing a website without considering these implications can result in a site that doesn't resonate with visitors or meet their needs. Additionally, a poorly optimised site can lead to high bounce rates and low engagement, affecting the site's success.</p>

<h2>Usability Heuristics:</h2>
     <img src="Images/SurferSilhouette_Extension.png" alt="Website Logo" class="logo">

<p>Usability heuristics are guidelines that can improve the overall usability of a website. These guidelines are based on user research and best practices and can improve the user experience. Being aware of these heuristics is crucial when designing a website to ensure that it's user-friendly and easy to use. Some of the common usability heuristics include visibility of system status, consistency, and error prevention.</p>

<p>Following these usability heuristics can result in a website that is easy to use, intuitive, and improves the user experience. Being aware of these heuristics can help designers identify potential usability issues and improve the website's design accordingly. Failing to follow these heuristics can lead to a site that is difficult to use, frustrating, and negatively impacts the user experience.</p>

<h2>Design Elements:</h2>
    <img src="Images/SurferSilhouette_Extension.png" alt="Website Logo" class="logo">

<p>Design elements are critical components of a website that can greatly impact the user experience. These elements include typography, colour schemes, layout, images, icons, buttons, and other interactive elements such as forms, menus, and animations. Being aware of these design elements is important when building a website because they can greatly impact the user experience and determine whether visitors stay on the site or leave immediately.</p>

<p>Designing a website with these design elements in mind can result in a visually appealing, easy to navigate, and intuitive site. Being aware of the design elements can help designers make informed decisions about the site's design and functionality, resulting in a more effective website. Additionally, being aware of these design elements can help designers identify potential issues and improve the site's design accordingly. Failing to consider these design elements can lead to a site that is difficult to use, unappealing, and negatively impacts the user experience.</p>
